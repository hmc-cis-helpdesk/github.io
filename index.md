# How to setup Mobility Print on your computer

**Mobility Print** adds an **HMC Student Printing** printer that lets you print directly from desktop and mobile devices to any of our four student printers’ release stations.

## For Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Connect to Claremont-WPA or Claremont-ETC. If off campus, connect to the VPN.

2. **Install Mobility Print**: Go to our Student Printing setup page and install PaperCut Mobility Print. It will auto-detect what kind of device you’re using. Mobility Print will install a printer named HMC Student Printing on your device.

3. **Send print jobs**: Send your print job from your device to the HMC Student Printing printer. Mobility Print does not control your print job settings. If you want to print double-sided, configure the print settings on your computer to print double-sided.

4. **Login**: At the login, enter your HMC username with your HMC password.

5. **Go to a release station**: Go to any release station to release your print job. 

**Note**: Installing PaperCut Mobility Print more than once will lead to duplicate HMC Student Printing printers appearing on your device. If this happens, you can remove any duplicate printers.

For more information on setting up PaperCut Mobility print on your device, please refer to PaperCut’s Mobility Print setup guides:

# How to use Web Print
**Web Print** is an alternative option allowing you to print from your web browser.

1. Connect to Wi-Fi: Connect to Claremont-WPA or Claremont-ETC. If off campus, connect to the VPN.
2. Login to Web Print: Go to the HMC Student Web Print login. Click Web Print on the left sidebar.
3. Submit your print job: Click Submit a Job.
   - For single-sided printing: Select print\HMC Student Printing

4. Specify how many copies you want, then click Upload Documents. Click Upload and upload your document. Click Submit a job. Use the release station at any student printer on campus to release your print job.

# How to use the release stations
The release stations are how you release your print jobs to any of the four student printers. You will see a computer with a login screen and a card reader near the printers.
 
To release a print job:
1. **Login**: At the release station, enter your HMC credentials or swipe your HMC ID in the card reader to log in.
2. **Release print jobs**: Once you log in, you will see a list of print jobs available under your account. Click Print on the right-hand side for the print job you want to release. The printer will release your print job after.
